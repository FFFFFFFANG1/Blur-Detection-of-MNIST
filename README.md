# Blur-Detection-of-MNIST

## 🚀 Task

When collecting data for MNIST, some digit images are blurry due to technical issues. Use machine learning techniques to identify these blurry images, with overhead as small as possible. Byeond CNN, one should also try simpler methods like linear classifier accompanied by feature extractions. You may find a more detailed description of the task in `questions_cig.pdf`.

## 🧐 Methods

I have used PCA + Logistic Regression, Perceptron, and CNN to perform the task. Surprisingly, Perceptron with careful image processing can reach a similar performance to CNN network. You can find a more detailed report in `report.pdf`.

## 🙇 Special Thanks

I want to show my sincere thanks to Prof. Minh N.Do. As the interview question for the lab admission (they updated the question now so don't copy), I started from this task to a broad computer vision world. Working in his lab also let me to explore more CV topics like ResNet, ViT, and image processing.

🌟 This project marks my start of computer vision journey
